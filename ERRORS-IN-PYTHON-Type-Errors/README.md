#### ERRORS IN PYTHON

## Type Errors

A TypeError is reported by the Python interpreter when an operation is applied to a variable of an inappropriate type.

This can occur in Python when one attempts to use an operator on something of the incorrect type.

For example, letâ€™s see what happens when we try and add together two incompatible types:

```py
piggy_bank = '2' + 0.25

```
There will be an TypeError error message:

```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "script.py", line 1, in <module>
    piggy_bank = '2' + 0.25
TypeError: must be str, not float

```
This error is reporting that 0.25 is not a string.

Some common type errors are:

- Accidentally adding or subtracting a string value.
- Call a function on something of the incorrect type.
